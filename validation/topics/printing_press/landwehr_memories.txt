The printing press is a mechanical device for applying pressure to an inked surface resting upon a print medium.

It marked a dramatic improvement on earlier printing methods and accelerated the process of transferring ink.

The invention and global spread of the printing press was one of the most influential events in the second millennium.

Johannes Gutenberg invented the movable-type printing press in Germany around 1440, which started the Printing Revolution.

A single Renaissance movable-type printing press could produce up to 3,600 pages per workday, compared to forty by hand-printing and a few by hand-copying.

Gutenberg's hand mould and the movable-type printing press drastically reduced the cost of printing books and other documents in Europe.

A finding in 2015 brought evidence of quires printed in 1444â€“1446 possibly assigned to Procopius Waldvogel.
