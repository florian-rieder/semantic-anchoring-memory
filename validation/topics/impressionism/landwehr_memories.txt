Impressionism was a 19th-century art movement characterized by small, visible brush strokes, open composition, and an emphasis on accurate depiction of light and ordinary subject matter.

The Impressionists faced opposition from the conventional art community in France.

The name of the style was derived from a Claude Monet work, "Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise)".

J. M. W. Turner's work was influential on the birth of Impressionism.
