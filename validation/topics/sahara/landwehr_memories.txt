The Sahara is the largest hot desert in the world, spanning across North Africa.

It covers an area of 9,200,000 square kilometers (3,600,000 sq mi).

The name "Sahara" is derived from Arabic, meaning "desert".

The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding certain regions.

It can be divided into several regions, including the western Sahara, the central Ahaggar Mountains, the Tibesti Mountains, the Aïr Mountains, the Ténéré desert, and the Libyan Desert.

The Sahara has alternated between desert and savanna grassland in a 20,000-year cycle caused by the precession of Earth's axis.
