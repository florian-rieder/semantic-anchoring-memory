The 2024 French farmers' protests started on 16 January 2024 and are ongoing.

The protests are mainly organized by agricultural unions, including FNSEA, Young Farmers, Rural Coordination, and Confédération paysanne.

The goals of the protests include ending the tax on diesel, payment of aid planned by the state, and ending free trade agreement negotiations.

The methods used in the protests include protests, street blockades, and free tolls.

There have been 2 deaths, 3 injuries, and at least 91 arrests as a result of the protests.

The movement started in Occitania, with the first demonstration in Toulouse on 16 January.

The protests have caused major road blockages and have damaged property, including government buildings.

A 37-year-old farmer and her 12-year-old daughter were killed in a car crash at a roadblock on 23 January.

The blockades of autoroutes were removed by 3 February 2024.
