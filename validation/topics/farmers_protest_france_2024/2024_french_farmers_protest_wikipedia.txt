Improvised road blockage in January 2024 by the FNSEA in Occitania at L'Isle-Jourdain

The 2024 French farmers' protests are a series of protests and road blockages organized mainly by agricultural unions (FNSEA, Young Farmers [fr], Rural Coordination [fr], Confédération paysanne [fr]) since 18 January 2024.[2] The farmers protested against low food prices, proposed reductions in state subsidies for farmers' diesel fuel, and a EU-Mercosur free trade agreement.[3][4]

In response to the protests, Gabriel Attal's government scrapped proposed reductions in government subsidies for agricultural diesel and other measures to reduce financial and bureaucratic burdens for farmers, but the protests persisted.[5]

The movement started from Occitania,[6][7] first with a demonstration in Toulouse on 16 January, which had no impact. Occitan farmers then decided to block the A64 motorway on 18 January.[8][9][10] The movement has damaged property, including government buildings.[5]

On 23 January, a 37-year-old farmer and her 12-year-old daughter were killed after a car crashed into a roadblock where they were standing. The farmer's husband was badly injured.[11][12]

Major roads have been affected.[13] The protests have reportedly besieged Paris.[14]
