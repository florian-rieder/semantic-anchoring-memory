The concept of information hazard, or infohazard, is defined as a risk that arises from the dissemination of true information that may cause harm or enable some agent to cause harm.

Philosopher Nick Bostrom defined the concept of information hazard in 2011.

Information hazards contradict the idea of Freedom of information, as they suggest that some types of information are too dangerous for every single person to have access to.

One example of an information hazard is instructions for creating a thermonuclear weapon, as following the instructions could cause massive amounts of harm to others.

There are two major categories of information hazard: adversarial hazard, where information can be purposefully used by a bad actor to hurt others, and unintended consequence hazard, where harm is not purposeful but is merely an unintended consequence that harms the person who learns it.

Subsets of these major categories include data hazards, idea hazards, and knowing-too-much hazards.

In biotechnology, information hazards can also arise.
