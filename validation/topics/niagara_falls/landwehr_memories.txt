Niagara Falls is located on the border of Ontario in Canada and New York in the United States

The three waterfalls at Niagara Falls are Horseshoe Falls, American Falls, and Bridal Veil Falls

Horseshoe Falls is the largest and most powerful of the three waterfalls

The Niagara River, which drains Lake Erie into Lake Ontario, forms the falls

Niagara Falls has the highest flow rate of any waterfall in North America with a vertical drop of more than 50 m

During peak daytime tourist hours, more than 168,000 m3 of water goes over the crest of the falls every minute

Niagara Falls is a valuable source of hydroelectric power

Balancing recreational, commercial, and industrial uses has been a challenge for the stewards of the falls since the 19th century
