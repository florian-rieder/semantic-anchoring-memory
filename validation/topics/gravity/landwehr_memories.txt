Gravity is a fundamental interaction in physics that causes mutual attraction between all things that have mass

It is the weakest of the four fundamental interactions

Gravity determines the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and even light at the macroscopic scale

On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects and is responsible for sublunar tides in the oceans

Gravity also guides the growth of plants through the process of gravitropism and influences the circulation of fluids in multicellular organisms

The gravitational attraction between gaseous matter in the universe caused it to form stars and eventually condensed into galaxies

Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become weaker as objects get farther away
