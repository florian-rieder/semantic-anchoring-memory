The global map shows sea temperature rises of 0.5 to 1 degree Celsius; land temperature rises of 1 to 2 degree Celsius; and Arctic temperature rises of up to 4 degrees Celsius.

Earth's average surface air temperature has increased almost 1.5 °C (about 2.5 °F) since the Industrial Revolution.

Climate change describes global warming and its effects on Earth's climate system, caused primarily by humans burning fossil fuels.

Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices add to greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane.

Climate change has an increasing impact on the environment, including the expansion of deserts, more common heat waves and wildfires, thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers, sea ice decline, more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes.

Rapid environmental change is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct, and some effects will continue for centuries, including ocean heating, ocean acidification, and sea level rise.
