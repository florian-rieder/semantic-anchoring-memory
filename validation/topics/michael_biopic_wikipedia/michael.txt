Production
Development

In November 2019, it was first announced that Graham King secured the rights to produce a film about Michael Jackson, with John Logan set to write the screenplay.[2] In February 2022, Lionsgate acquired the film's distribution rights.[1] In June 2022, casting began; Kimberly Hardin is the casting director. Production was expected to start in 2023.[3] In January 2023, Antoine Fuqua was announced as the director of the project.[4] That same month, Jackson's nephew Jaafar Jackson was set to portray Michael Jackson.[5] In January 2024, newcomer Juliano Krue Valdi had been cast as a young Michael,[6] as well as Colman Domingo as Joe Jackson,[7] and Nia Long as Katherine Jackson.[8] Also that month, Miles Teller was reported to be in talks to play one of Jackson's attorneys.[9] In February, Teller was confirmed to play John Branca.[10]
Filming

Principal photography was scheduled to begin in mid-2023 over 80 days in Santa Barbara and was projected to spend $120 million on crew wages and vendors, according to the California Film Commission.[11] Filming was delayed in September 2023 due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[12] Filming eventually began on January 22, 2024,[13] with Dion Beebe serving as the cinematographer. Barbara Ling serves as the production designer, and Marci Rodgers as the costume designer.[14]
Release

In October 2023, Lionsgate and Universal Pictures jointly announced that the latter would distribute the film internationally except Japan, while the former would serve as distributor domestically.[15] Michael is scheduled to be released in the United States on April 18, 2025.[13]
