A Fulton County, Georgia grand jury indicted nineteen people, including former United States President Donald Trump, on 41 counts overall, with Trump facing thirteen of them.

The indictment alleges a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome of the 2020 presidential election in favor of Trump.

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis stated that the accused had eleven days to surrender.

Trump faced a charge of violating the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) along with his co-defendants.

Trump denied tampering with the election and his 2024 presidential campaign claimed the prosecution was "election interference".

The campaign also questioned the timing of the indictment and accused the prosecutor of bias.
