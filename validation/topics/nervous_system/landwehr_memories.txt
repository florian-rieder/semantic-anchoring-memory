The nervous system coordinates actions and sensory information in animals.

Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 550 to 600 million years ago.

In vertebrates, the nervous system consists of the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).

The PNS consists mainly of nerves, which are enclosed bundles of long fibers that connect the CNS to every other part of the body.

The PNS is divided into three separate subsystems: the somatic, autonomic, and enteric nervous systems.

The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems.

The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy, while the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state.

The enteric nervous system functions to control the gastrointestinal system.
