Pop art is an art movement that emerged in the United Kingdom and the United States during the mid- to late-1950s

The movement includes imagery from popular and mass culture, such as advertising, comic books, and mundane mass-produced objects

Pop art aims to use images of popular culture in art, emphasizing the banal or kitschy elements of any culture, most often through the use of irony

Pop art is associated with the artists' use of mechanical means of reproduction or rendering techniques

Early artists that shaped the pop art movement include Eduardo Paolozzi, Richard Hamilton, Larry Rivers, Ray Johnson, Robert Rauschenberg, and Jasper Johns

Pop art is widely interpreted as a reaction to the then-dominant ideas of abstract expressionism, as well as an expansion of those ideas

Pop art and minimalism are considered to be art movements that precede postmodern art, or are some of the earliest examples of postmodern art themselves

Pop art often takes imagery that is currently in use in advertising, with product labeling and logos figuring prominently in the artwork
