The Yellow Vests Protests began in France on 17 November 2018.

The movement initially focused on economic justice and later called for institutional political reforms.

An online petition in May 2018 attracted nearly 1 million signatures, leading to mass demonstrations in November.

The protests were motivated by rising crude oil and fuel prices, high cost of living, and economic inequality.

The protesters called for lower fuel taxes, a reintroduction of the solidarity tax on wealth, and a minimum wage increase, among other things.

President Emmanuel Macron announced the cancellation of the fuel tax increase and other social measures on 10 December, leading to a shift in the movement's focus towards citizens' initiative referendums.

Participation in the protests diminished due to violence caused by police blast balls.

The movement continued after the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions were lifted.

The protests attracted a diverse group of participants from across the political spectrum, with many expressing political alienation.
